The mapper provides three methods: houseMemberSetToRestApiResponseHouseMemberSet, houseMemberDtoSetToHouseMemberSet, and houseMemberSetToRestApiResponseAddHouseMemberSet. These methods map sets of House Member objects to/from REST API responses, allowing for the conversion of data between the two formats. The mapper utilizes the Mapstruct package to provide a structured approach to mapping data between different formats.","items":[{"id":"d4782b49-94e1-16a7-f645-b1e463b08758","ancestors":[],"type":"function","description":"provides mapping between House Member objects and their corresponding REST API response versions.","name":"HouseMemberMapper","code":"@Mapper\npublic interface HouseMemberMapper {\n  Set<com.myhome.model.HouseMember> houseMemberSetToRestApiResponseHouseMemberSet(\n      Set<HouseMember> houseMemberSet);\n\n  Set<HouseMember> houseMemberDtoSetToHouseMemberSet(Set<HouseMemberDto> houseMemberDtoSet);\n\n  Set<com.myhome.model.HouseMember> houseMemberSetToRestApiResponseAddHouseMemberSet(\n      Set<HouseMember> houseMemberSet);\n}","location":{"start":24,"insert":24,"offset":" ","indent":0},"item_type":"interface","length":10}]}}}
